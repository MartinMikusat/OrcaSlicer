# OrcaSlicer Learning Resources

This document contains curated learning resources for understanding the mathematical and computational foundations behind OrcaSlicer and 3D printing slicer development.

## Core Computational Geometry

### "Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications" by de Berg, Cheong, van Kreveld, and Overmars
**Why read:** The gold standard textbook for computational geometry. Chapter 4.8 on "Degeneracies and Robustness" is essential for understanding why OrcaSlicer uses fixed-point coordinates instead of floating-point.

### Jonathan Shewchuk's Papers
- **"Robust Adaptive Floating-Point Geometric Predicates"**
- **"Lecture Notes on Geometric Robustness"**

**Why read:** These are the seminal papers that solved the precision problem in computational geometry. Shewchuk's work is the theoretical foundation for robust geometric algorithms used in production software like CGAL and indirectly influences OrcaSlicer's design decisions.

**Access:** Available free online from Stanford/Berkeley

## Fixed-Point Coordinate Systems

### CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library) Documentation
- **"Number Types and Arithmetic"** section
- **"Exact Predicates Inexact Constructions"** kernel documentation

**Why read:** Real-world implementation examples of exact arithmetic in practice. Shows how production libraries handle the same precision issues that OrcaSlicer's fixed-point system addresses. Essential for understanding industry-standard approaches.

### Clipper Library Documentation
**Why read:** Clipper uses integer coordinates for 2D polygon operations (similar to OrcaSlicer's approach). Excellent practical example of how fixed-point arithmetic enables robust boolean operations on polygons.

## 3D Printing and Mesh Processing

### "Polygon Mesh Processing" by Botsch, Kobbelt, Pauly, Alliez, and Levy
